Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
  
  - To me,
  
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  
  -I would advise them to start the assignment early on to make sure they get enough time to revise it
  
  -I would advise them to save enough time to test the program wiwthout assuming that the program will run perfectly based on one's conceptual 
   models, sometimes it might flip upside down and having saved time allows neccessary modifications
  
  -Ask for help whenevr it is possible
