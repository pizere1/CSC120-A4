- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
  
  - To me, I think Encapsulation pushes me to pay attention to every detail that belong to every specific location and propelles me to do a           more intention preparation for my programs to ensure that I understand well the type relationships of classes will have with each other and     how to handle them regardless of the restriction of the objects' nature.
  
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  
  -I would advise them to start the assignment early on to make sure they get enough time to revise it
  
  -I would advise them to save enough time to test the program wiwthout assuming that the program will run perfectly based on one's conceptual 
   models, sometimes it might flip upside down and having saved time allows neccessary modifications
  
  -Ask for help whenevr it is possible
